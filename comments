Deployment Approaches:
a. Image-related Deployment:
- This approach involves updating application images directly into the UAT Azure Container Registry (ACR). The Release Team is responsible for applying the target YAML file and verifying pod status.
- Process: Application Team pushes the updated image into UAT ACR, Release Team applies the target YAML file, and verifies pod status.

b. Functional Changes Deployment:
- Functional changes deployment employs a backup-restore utility. The deployment process follows the outlined steps:
b1. Developer commits changes in the lower environment.
b2. Changes are promoted to higher environments by generating a JSON file from source environment using the utility (also known as Backup operation).
b3. Upon generating the JSON file for deployment, a rollback file is also generated from the target environment.
b4. Deployment is initiated using the JSON file generated for deployment through the utility.
b5. Following deployment via the utility, the deploy operation must also be executed from the Application Team's platform.
b6. Pod status is checked post-deployment.
b7. In case of rollback necessity, the process is executed using the JSON generated in step b3, replicating each step similar to deployment.
